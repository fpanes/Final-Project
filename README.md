# Final Project
## Attack, Defense &amp; Analysis of a Vulnerable Network
### The objective was to put into reality a variety of principles covered throughout the cybersecurity course, as well as to function as a pentester and SOC analyst.
  * Find vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress server.

  * Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.

  * Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious activity on the network traffic.
### Read through the [Offensive](https://github.com/fpanes/FinalProject/blob/main/Offensive.md), [Defensive](https://github.com/fpanes/FinalProject/blob/main/Defensive.md), and [Network Analysis](https://github.com/fpanes/FinalProject/blob/main/Network.md) files to see the work, process and findings that leads up to the final presentation.
#### View the Google slide defensive project presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vs7FdZhMwk7gnJwQfN80L3Gzk6EEYVUzGoGSRkDlJHI/edit?usp=sharing).
Note: The presentation was prepared in collaboration with classmates. We selected to discuss the defensive side to include: network topology, vulnerabilities/weaknesses, alarms and thresholds in Elastic Watcher (Kibana), and hardening approaches. All other documentation for offensive, defensive, and network analysis, on the other hand, was my own personal labor. On the final day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp, we were solely assigned to work as a group to present our results.
